## Constraining Dark Energy with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (v2)

# Context
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a redux of a project I completed in my third year of university.
I intended to only briefly revisit it, but the original directory was a
mess, I had moved from using Nbodykit (which no longer runs on my 
laptop) to Triumvirate for power-/bispectrum estimation, and after a
year of cosmology I was much better equipped to appreciate and execute
it -- so I redid it. 

# Acknowledgments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Many thanks to Dr. Florian Beutler (https://mystatisticsblog.blogspot.com), 
for the project pipeline and the original code upon which this project was 
based (without which this would have been a significantly longer and more 
arduous endeavour). Additional thanks to Dr. Mike Wang, for his Triumvirate 
package (https://github.com/MikeSWang/Triumvirate) and extensive assistance 
with this tool.
